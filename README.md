# practice-portfolio

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a portfolio to eventually update and allow potential employers to use as a reference to view the work I have accomplished. Many of the "projects" linked on this page are minimalistic exercises performed during my coding bootcamp and simply link to their respective repositories rather than any sort of deployed application. As I complete more projects, I intend to update this page accordingly.
